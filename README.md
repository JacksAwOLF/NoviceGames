where Library is a hidden folder. The default AppId seems to be com.company.game

For mac users, when running on GameMaker Studio IDE, the save files are located at:
/Users/\<user\>/Library/Application Support/com.yoyogames.macyoyorunner

When running a build exe on Windows, the save files are located at C:\\Users\\<user\>\\AppData\\Local\\MapMaker, or around there
